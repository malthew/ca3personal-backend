What is the advantage (if any) for a REST-based API of using JWTâ€™s compared to session Cookies
	- The advantage is that the token gets saved on the client instead of on the server. If the token was saved on the server, we might not hit 
	  the same server the next time we want to login, and therefor cant access our token and wont get logged in.  


What is the disadvantage (if any) with the implemented JWT-solution
	- If a employee of a firm leaks the key, then everything will be compromised.
	- If you try to logout then the token will still be saved for a time whitch means you cant login again before the token expire.


What will a client (Single Page WEB, Mobile App, etc.) have to do in order to use this API
	- A login page and different users.
